1. Global Variables:

countdownValue: The default countdown value, set to 31.
running: A flag to indicate if the countdown is running.
sleep_time: The time (in milliseconds) to sleep between states.
debugTime: A time value used for debugging purposes.
2. Pins Assignment:

displayUnidadesPins: The pins used for the units display.
displayDecenasPins: The pins used for the tens display.
displayDecenasPins_ctl: The control pin for the tens display.
pinsObjectsU and pinsObjectsD: Lists to store the pin objects for the units and tens displays, respectively.
pinsObjectsD_ctl: A list to store the control pin object for the tens display.
pinTurbine, pinExtractor, and pinLigth: The pins used for the turbine, extractor, and light, respectively.
pinDoorSen and pinButton: The pins used for the door sensor and button, respectively.
3. Functions:

setupDisplayU(pins): Sets up the pins for the units display and stores the pin objects in the pinsObjectsU list.
setupDisplayD(pins): Sets up the pins for the tens display, including the control pin, and stores the pin objects in the pinsObjectsD and pinsObjectsD_ctl lists.
setupOutput(pin): Sets up a pin as an output and returns the pin object.
setupInput(btn_pin): Sets up a pin as an input with a pull-up resistor and returns the pin object.
displayNumber(displayTensPins, displayUnitsPins, number): Displays the given number on the units and tens displays.
4. State Machine:

StateMachine class:
__init__(self): Initializes the state machine with the initial state set to 'START'.
run(self): Runs the state machine by calling the appropriate state function based on the current state.
state0(self): The 'START' state, which sets up the displays, outputs, and inputs.
state1(self): The 'SETTINGENV' state, which displays the countdown value and sets the initial state of the turbine, extractor, and light.
state2(self): The 'WAITING' state, which checks the button and door sensor inputs and transitions to the 'PLAYING' state if the conditions are met.
state3(self): The 'PLAYING' state, which updates the countdown display, decrements the countdown value, and transitions back to the 'SETTINGENV' state when the countdown reaches 0 or the door sensor is triggered.
5. Pin Configuration:

The code iterates through pins 0 to 39 and attempts to set them as outputs. It prints a message indicating whether the pin was configured correctly or not.
The code then prints the values of the pins in the displayUnidades_pins list, which is likely a reference to the displayUnidadesPins list.
The provided code implements a state machine-based control system for a device with a countdown display, turbine, extractor, and light. The state machine manages the different operational states of the device, such as setting up the environment, waiting for user input, and playing the countdown. The code also includes functions for setting up the display, inputs, and outputs, as well as a function for displaying the countdown value on the display.
